## 🔐 Authentication

### JWT Token Authentication
The API uses JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication for secure access. 

**Key Notes:**
- 🔑 Tokens have expiration time for security
- ❌ If you see _"Authentication credentials were not provided"_:
  1. Your token has expired
  2. You need to re-authenticate
- 🔄 Get new tokens at: `http://localhost:8000/api/token/`

### Using Swagger UI
1. Visit `/swagger/`
2. Click **"Authorize"** button
3. Enter your token:  
   `Bearer <your_token_here>`
4. All API requests will now include your token automatically

## Swagger Authentication

## 🧪 Testing the System

### 1. Using Swagger UI
- Interactive API documentation at `/swagger/`
- Test endpoints directly in browser
- Automatic token inclusion after authorization
- See request/response formats

### 2. Using cURL
```bash
# Get token
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"username":"youruser", "password":"yourpass"}' \
http://localhost:8000/api/token/

# List employees
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..." \
http://localhost:8000/api/employees/

# Filter by department
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token" \
"http://localhost:8000/api/employees/?department=HR"

# Create new employee
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer your_token" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name": "John Doe", "department": 1, "position": "Developer"}' \
http://localhost:8000/api/employees/

```

This web app delivers a fully functional Employee Management System with secure APIs and clear visualizations.
Though Docker and deployment are pending, it’s simple to run and test locally.
